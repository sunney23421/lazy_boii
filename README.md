I've been assigned to give all google from qusetion to 200 students. I though I'm not gonna do that :shit: so I decided to write a python script to help me to done my task for me.

I used PyCliker to clike to all google from which is kinna hard code but it's much more flexible than others methon.

This not only just ramdon cliker but I put effort to implement some login depent on the question. Which is you can change all number as you wish. :ok_hand:
